I obtained my Ph.D. degree at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2019, under the supervison of [Prof. Jeffrey Xu Yu](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-yu-xu-jeffrey/). Prior to that, I received the B.Eng. from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2014.

I'm looking for highly-motivated Ph.D., master and undergraduate students. If you are interested, please drop me an email without hesitation.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
